## Problem Statements  
Face detection has been around for ages. Taking a step forward, human emotion
displayed by face and felt by brain, captured in either video, electric signal (EEG) or
image form can be approximated. Human emotion detection is the need of the hour
so that modern artificial intelligent systems can emulate and gauge reactions from
face. This can be helpful to make informed decisions be it regarding identification of
intent, promotion of offers or security related threats. Recognizing emotions from
images or video is a trivial task for human eye, but proves to be very challenging for
machines and requires many image processing techniques for feature extraction.
Several machine learning algorithms are suitable for this job. Any detection or
recognition by machine learning requires training algorithm and then testing them
on a suitable dataset.
